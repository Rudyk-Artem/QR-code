# QR-code
This is a QR code generator.
To use it, you need to run QR code.py and in the window that appears, enter the text and the necessary settings or open the file from your computer and press the âœ” button. The generated QR code will be displayed on the screen and a QR code.png will be created in the QR code.py file directory.

If QR code.py does not open for you due to the lack of some libraries, install these libraries via the console using the commands that I left as a comment at the beginning of the code.

My program supports different localizations and if you want to add your own, you can copy and translate one of the existing files in translator/ . To make the localization appear in the list of available localizations, add the name of your localization file to the db.txt file after Languages: with ; at the end.
